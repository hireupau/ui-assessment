# UI Assessment

## Task

The menu options are:

- Dashboard
- Search

- How the label the navigation to provide context for accessibility technologies to understand it is a "Main navigation"?
- How to markup a navigation for accessibility?
- How to represent an active link in the navigation?
- How would you approach including the SVG icons?

**Question:** While there are only few SVGs here, how might we best accommodate a system of more SVGs?

### Design

#### Fonts

| Border      | `#dde1e3` |
| Hover/Focus | `#d8f7fb` |

**Question:** What would be your approach to organise colors in a larger palette? How would you maintain colors as part of a wider design system?
